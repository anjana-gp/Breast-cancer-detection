# Breast-cancer-detection
Design and optimise deep learning architectures for the detection of breast  cancer through microscopic images. 

This project has been taken place in 3 phases
1.Phase1: The transfer learning models namely Inception, Mobilenet, VGG and Resnet-50 are trained on the stained Breast cancer images.
2.Phase2: The model with most accuracy is now trained on the GLCM features which are extrcated and 7ML models(SVC, gradientBoost, Logistic regression, KNN, Descision tree, XGB, RandomForest) are trained on these features aswell.
3.Phase3: All of the 7 ML models are concatenated with the sequential model to increase its metrics values.
